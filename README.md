![Alt Text](Covid.png)

## Overview
The **COVID-19 Analytics Dashboard** for Indonesia is an interactive visualization tool developed using **Streamlit**, **Plotly**, and **Altair**. This dashboard allows users to explore key metrics related to the spread of COVID-19 across various regions in Indonesia. With filtering options for location, year, month, and day, the dashboard provides insights into trends like total cases, active cases, recovered cases, and deaths. It also visualizes key data points through charts such as bar charts, pie charts, heatmaps, and more.

## Objectives
- **Explore COVID-19 trends**: View COVID-19 trends over time with interactive visualizations.
- **Regional analysis**: Visualize COVID-19 metrics across different locations and provinces in Indonesia.
- **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**: Display vital statistics like total cases, active cases, recovered cases, and deaths.
- **In-depth analysis**: Visualize the relationship between population density and COVID-19 cases using heatmaps and pie charts.

## Features
- **Filters**: Allows the user to select multiple locations, years, months, and days to filter the data.
- **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**: Displays metrics like total cases, active cases, recovered cases, and deaths.
- **Interactive Charts**: Includes bar charts, pie charts, and heatmaps to visualize COVID-19 data.
- **Location-wise Analysis**: Analyze COVID-19 data for different regions and visualize the infection rate using pie charts.
